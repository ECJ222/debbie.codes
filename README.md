# Debbie O'Brien

Head Developer Advocate at Bit with over 10 years experience in Frontend development. Microsoft Most Valuable Professional in developer technologies, Google Developer Expert in web technologies, GitHub Star, NuxtJS Ambassador and Cloudinary Media Developer Expert.

I have a special love for JavaScript frameworks especially Vue.js and Nuxt.js and improving performance with webpack and of course the JAMstack. I hold a Frontend and FullStack Tech Degree and am Microsoft certified. I am an international speaker and organiser of MallorcaJS and VueSpain. I contribute to open source. I am a teacher at Vue School and have created the Vue Router and Vue Internationalisation course and I am a writer for Ultimate Courses.

This is my website which I built in NuxtJS. I use it as my playground for trying out new stuff and having fun. Feel free to have a look around and copy whatever you like as the code is open source so if it helps you then great.
